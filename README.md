# FIKA Modpack
This repo contains a collection of mods used on a private FIKA Co-op server, intended to be installed and updated through [smarterskipper's MPT-Updater](https://github.com/smarterskipper/MPT-UPDATER/releases). It contains a gitignore template that is setup to ignore anything other than client mods, server mods, and configs.

You are required to already have an install of SPT and FIKA before installing this modpack, as it does not contain those necessary files. The latest version of FIKA will need two seperate files to be added to your SPT install, a [client mod](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin/releases) and a [server mod](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Server/releases/), otherwise you will not be able to connect.

This modlist will be updated as frequently as new updates for mods are released, provided they do not have any bugs or issues. Configs may also be done from time to time and will also require an update.
